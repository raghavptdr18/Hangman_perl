Hangman Game in Perl

-The word to guess is represented by a row of dashes, giving the number of letters in the word.
-If the player suggests a letter which occurs in the word, it should write it in all its correct positions
-If the suggested letter does not occur in the word, it should draw one element of a hanged man stick figure as a tally mark.

The game is over when:
- The player completes the word, or guesses the whole word correctly – Player Wins!
- Number of tries exceeds a limit (completes the hangman diagram) – Player loses!

Run the program by entering the command: perl Hangman.pl
